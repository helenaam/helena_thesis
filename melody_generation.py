# This program uses a machine learning method to generate a single-line melody given
# a set of single-line melodies that I have composed.  The method used in this program
# can be generalized to compose a single-line melody given an input of any set of
# single-line melodies.  If the general learner determines that the piece it will
# generate is "melodic," then running this method will be the first step.
